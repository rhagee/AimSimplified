AimSimplified

Simple reproduction of AimLab in a small static excercise with some soft settings.

First time learning Unity well.
First project developed in approx 18hrs (4 days in free time).

I don't know if am going to make it more complex. 
It was just a test for myself to understand if am able to learn quick.

Enjo! :D
